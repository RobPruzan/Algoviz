# AlgoViz

Algoviz is a playground designed to enable physical and programmatic interactions with graph-based data structures

## Features

- an infinite canvas made for constructing graphs quickly:
  - edge snapping
  - undirecrted and directed edges
  - select subset of nodes
  - drag subset of nodes
  - fully collect selection
  - assign values to nodes
- custom code execution server, where the output is piped back the browser and visualized
  - users write code in the provided code editor
  - the graph (represented as an adjaceny list) is an input to the function implemented
  - the output (that adheres to the websites schema) is visualized directly on the graph in the canvas
  - the stack/heap of the program is inspected during execution, so you can directly see values of variables, and time travel to understand state
- a set of useful graph traversal algorithims are provided in the app, which can be easily modified directly
